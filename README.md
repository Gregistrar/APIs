Web Scraper Projects

This repository is a work in progress. The plan is to automate a SQLite database to host tables of NHL player, team and game data.
So far I have team and roster data.

I will export the data for analysis and visualization. The site I will use for this is undecided so far. Still need to map this out after importing data.
